# FIP-GENERATIVE-AI-AND-DATA-SCIENCE-PROJECTS
This is a Repo to my internship Journey with FlexiSaf Internship Program (FIP) under the Generative AI and Data Science (GDAI)


### First Task
In my first deliverable. I was tasked to create a Python proram that simulates a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors between the user and the computer.

In my code I had to specify all possible choices of both the user and computer.
Using the rules of the Game, I was able to get the user's choice and match it with that of the computer, hence ensuring the user won, lost to the computer or determine if it was a tie.
